<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

The Diablo 2 TSV Parser package provides a Go implementation for parsing 
tab-separated value (TSV) files used for storing spreadsheets of data inside 
Diablo 2 archives.

The main data structure used in this package is the `TsvParser`. It allows you 
to read and retrieve data from TSV files by column name, making it easy to 
access and process data in the TSV format.

### Caveats
The Diablo 2 TSV format has the following caveats:
- The separator used in the TSV files is a tab character.
- The TSV files may have rows with the string "Expansion," which is skipped 
during parsing.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
To use this Diablo 2 TSV Parser package, ensure you have Go 1.16 or a later 
version installed, and your Go environment is set up correctly.

### Installation
To install the package, you can use Go's standard `go get` command:

```shell
go get -u github.com/gravestench/tsv
```
